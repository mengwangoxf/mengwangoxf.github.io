## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="meng.jpeg">

Dr. Meng Wang is a Reader in the Department of Computer Science, with research interests in programming languages and software engineering. He leads the [*Programming Languages Research Group at Bristol*](https://bristolpl.github.io) and is a member of [*IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi*](https://ifipwg21wiki.cs.kuleuven.be/IFIP21/WebHome). He is the International Director of [*School of Computer Science, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and Engineering Maths*](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/school-sceem/), and a member of the school management team and school board.

Previously, he was a lecturer at University of Kent, and an assistant professor at Chalmers University of Technology. He completed his DPhil (known as PhD elsewhere) at University of Oxford, and before that he studied at National University of Singapore.

## Research Interest

The central theme of his research is to apply theoretical rigour to practical programming, with the aim of improving the correctness and robustness of software systems. In particular, he focuses on designing languages and tools for software development and testing.

#### Research keywords

* Programming Languages
